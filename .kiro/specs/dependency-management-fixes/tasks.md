# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Clean and regenerate root application dependencies



  - Remove existing package-lock.json from root directory
  - Run npm install to regenerate lock file with current package.json
  - Verify no nodejs-demo-app dependencies are included in root lock file


  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.2_

- [ ] 2. Fix nodejs-demo-app dependency management
  - Update nodejs-demo-app package.json with correct dependency versions


  - Generate package-lock.json for nodejs-demo-app directory
  - Ensure all dependencies are properly locked and available
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.1, 2.4_



- [ ] 3. Update CI/CD pipeline for proper dependency handling
  - Modify .github/workflows/main.yml to handle both applications separately
  - Add working directory specifications for nodejs-demo-app steps
  - Update npm ci commands to run in correct contexts


  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 4. Verify and test dependency resolution
  - Test npm ci in root directory
  - Test npm ci in nodejs-demo-app directory
  - Run builds for both applications to ensure functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.4, 3.4_

- [ ]* 5. Run security audit and cleanup
  - Execute npm audit in both directories
  - Fix any security vulnerabilities found
  - Document any remaining issues
  - _Requirements: 2.3_
