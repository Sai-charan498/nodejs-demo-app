# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses TypeScript and ESLint errors in the React application to ensure code quality standards are met and the build pipeline passes successfully.

## Glossary

- **Linting System**: The ESLint tool that enforces code quality rules and standards
- **TypeScript Compiler**: The tool that checks TypeScript type safety and compilation
- **Build Pipeline**: The automated process that runs tests, linting, and builds the application
- **UI Components**: React components in the src/components/ui directory

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript compilation errors resolved, so that the build process completes successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TypeScript compiler runs, THE Linting System SHALL complete without any compilation errors
2. THE UI Components SHALL use proper TypeScript interface definitions without empty object types
3. THE Build Pipeline SHALL pass TypeScript type checking for all component files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ESLint import rules to be followed, so that the codebase maintains consistent import patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Linting System SHALL enforce ES6 import syntax instead of require() statements
2. WHEN processing configuration files, THE Linting System SHALL accept only ES6 import statements
3. THE Build Pipeline SHALL pass ESLint validation for all import statements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React Fast Refresh warnings addressed, so that development experience is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting non-component items from component files, THE Linting System SHALL provide clear guidance
2. THE UI Components SHALL separate component exports from utility exports where appropriate
3. THE Build Pipeline SHALL complete with minimal warnings that don't affect functionality
