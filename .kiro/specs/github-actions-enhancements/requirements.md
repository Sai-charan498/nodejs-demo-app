# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for the Node.js demo application by adding advanced deployment capabilities, security scanning, performance monitoring, and comprehensive reporting features to create a production-ready DevOps workflow.

## Glossary

- **GitHub_Actions_System**: The CI/CD automation platform that executes workflows on GitHub repositories
- **Docker_Hub_Registry**: The container registry service for storing and distributing Docker images
- **Security_Scanner**: Automated tools that analyze code and container images for vulnerabilities
- **Performance_Monitor**: Tools that measure application performance metrics during deployment
- **Deployment_Environment**: The target infrastructure where the application is deployed
- **Artifact_Storage**: GitHub's service for storing build artifacts and deployment packages
- **Notification_System**: Services that send alerts about workflow status and deployment results

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated Docker Hub publishing, so that I can distribute container images to production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a push occurs to the main branch, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL authenticate with Docker_Hub_Registry using secure credentials
2. WHEN Docker image build completes successfully, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL tag the image with both latest and commit SHA
3. WHEN image tagging completes, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL push the tagged images to Docker_Hub_Registry
4. IF Docker Hub authentication fails, THEN THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL terminate the workflow with clear error messaging
5. WHERE Docker Hub publishing is enabled, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL verify successful image push before proceeding

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want automated security scanning, so that I can identify vulnerabilities before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker image build completes, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL scan the container image for known vulnerabilities
2. WHEN code analysis begins, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL perform static code analysis for security issues
3. IF critical vulnerabilities are detected, THEN THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL fail the workflow and generate security report
4. WHEN security scan completes successfully, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL store scan results as workflow artifacts
5. WHERE security scanning is required, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL enforce vulnerability thresholds before deployment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want performance monitoring during deployment, so that I can ensure application meets performance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment testing begins, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL measure application startup time
2. WHEN load testing executes, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL verify response times meet defined thresholds
3. WHEN memory usage monitoring runs, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL ensure resource consumption stays within limits
4. IF performance thresholds are exceeded, THEN THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL fail deployment with performance report
5. WHERE performance monitoring is enabled, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL generate performance metrics artifacts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want comprehensive deployment reporting, so that I can track deployment success and failure patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflow completes, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL generate deployment summary with all test results
2. WHEN artifacts are created, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL store build logs, test reports, and deployment manifests
3. WHEN deployment succeeds, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL send success notifications with deployment details
4. IF deployment fails, THEN THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL send failure notifications with error analysis
5. WHERE reporting is configured, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL maintain deployment history and metrics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want environment-specific deployments, so that I can manage staging and production environments separately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN branch-based deployment triggers, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL determine target environment based on branch name
2. WHEN environment is determined, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL use environment-specific configuration and secrets
3. WHEN staging deployment completes, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL run integration tests against staging environment
4. IF production deployment is triggered, THEN THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL require manual approval before proceeding
5. WHERE multiple environments exist, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL maintain separate deployment tracking for each environment
