# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses npm dependency synchronization issues between package.json and package-lock.json files across the project, ensuring proper dependency management and successful CI/CD pipeline execution.

## Glossary

- **Dependency Management System**: The npm package manager that handles project dependencies
- **Lock File**: The package-lock.json file that locks specific versions of dependencies
- **CI Pipeline**: The continuous integration workflow that builds and tests the application
- **Node Application**: The Express.js application in the nodejs-demo-app directory
- **React Application**: The main Vite React application in the root directory

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want npm ci to run successfully, so that the CI/CD pipeline can install dependencies reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN npm ci runs, THE Dependency Management System SHALL install all packages without sync errors
2. THE Lock File SHALL contain all dependencies referenced in package.json files
3. THE CI Pipeline SHALL complete dependency installation without missing package errors
4. THE Dependency Management System SHALL maintain consistent package versions across environments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean dependency trees in both applications, so that there are no conflicting or unnecessary packages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Node Application SHALL have only necessary dependencies for Express.js functionality
2. THE React Application SHALL have properly organized production and development dependencies
3. WHEN analyzing dependencies, THE Dependency Management System SHALL show no security vulnerabilities
4. THE Lock File SHALL reflect the exact dependency structure defined in package.json

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent Node.js and npm versions across environments, so that builds are reproducible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CI Pipeline SHALL use compatible Node.js versions specified in engine requirements
2. WHEN installing dependencies, THE Dependency Management System SHALL respect version constraints
3. THE Node Application SHALL specify minimum Node.js version requirements
4. THE React Application SHALL be compatible with the specified Node.js version range
